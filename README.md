**A fluid, intuitive 3D model management system** built with Qt and OpenGL. **Primary mission: efficient tagging, organization, and discovery of 3D media assets.** Features 3D visualization and CNC workflow tools that enhance but never complicate the core model management experience.

**Bottom Line**: Find, tag, and organize your 3D models effortlessly. Everything else is secondary.

## üéØ Fluid Interface Design

### Model Management First
The interface is optimized for the **80/20 rule** - 80% of users need only 20% of features for basic model management:

- **Instant Model Import**: Drag-and-drop with auto-tagging
- **Real-time Search**: Type to find models across all metadata
- **Visual Organization**: Thumbnail grids with batch selection
- **Smart Tagging**: Auto-suggest, hierarchical tags, bulk operations

### Tabbed Canvas Workflow
Different canvases for different expertise levels:

- **Project Canvas**: Simple model management for everyone
- **Design Canvas**: Advanced visualization for power users
- **Cut List/CNC Canvases**: Specialized tools when needed

### Responsiveness Requirements
- **Search**: ‚â§100ms for real-time model discovery
- **Navigation**: 60+ FPS for smooth interface interaction
- **Loading**: Progressive display within 2 seconds
- **Operations**: All background processed, UI never blocks

## üìà Use Case Priority

1. **Digital Asset Manager**: Tag and find 3D models quickly
2. **Project Organizer**: Structure models into coherent collections
3. **3D Viewer**: Visualize and inspect models when needed
4. **CNC Planner**: Prepare models for manufacturing (optional)

## üöÄ Key Features

**Core Mission - Model Management**:
- **Fluid Interface**: Zero learning curve for basic model tagging and organization
- **Instant Search**: Real-time discovery across thousands of models and tags
- **Smart Tagging**: Auto-suggest tags, batch tagging, hierarchical organization
- **Visual Organization**: Thumbnail grids, project hierarchies, custom collections

**Performance & Reliability**:
- **Large Model Support**: Handle 500MB+ models with progressive loading (‚â§10s)
- **Responsive Design**: Never blocks UI, always shows progress, graceful cancellation
- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming architecture with intelligent caching
- **Cross-Platform**: Native performance on Windows, Linux, and macOS

**Enhanced Capabilities**:
- **3D Visualization**: OpenGL-accelerated viewing with LOD rendering
- **Mesh Repair**: Background processing for model optimization
- **CNC Integration**: Cut list optimization and feed/speed calculation with standard .tools JSON files
- **Project Management**: Structured organization with metadata and notes

**Technical Excellence**:
- **Local-First**: Complete data control, no cloud dependencies
- **Transparent Operation**: Comprehensive logging and performance metrics
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin system for specialized workflows

## üìã Performance Guarantees

- **Mesh Repair**: ‚â§5 seconds for complex models
- **Memory Usage**: <2GB for 500MB models (streaming architecture)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: Qt 6.2+ with OpenGL, Widgets, and Charts modules
- **Interface**: Fluid, responsive design with Qt's graphics view framework
- **Search Engine**: Full-text search with real-time results and faceted filtering
- **Graphics**: OpenGL 4.6+ with LOD rendering for large model performance
- **3D Model Loading**: Assimp library optimized for 500MB+ file support
- **Background Processing**: QtConcurrent for non-blocking model operations
- **Database**: SQLite for fast metadata queries and tagging
- **Build System**: Modern CMake (3.16+) with target-based organization

### Interface Design Philosophy
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show only what users need, when they need it
- **Contextual Actions**: Right-click menus, drag-and-drop, keyboard shortcuts
- **Visual Feedback**: Live thumbnails, progress bars, status indicators
- **Smart Defaults**: Auto-tagging, suggested metadata, intelligent organization

### Widget-Based Design
Every feature is implemented as a dockable, floating widget that can be:
- Added, removed, and rearranged freely
- Tabbed together for space efficiency
- Popped out into separate windows
- Nested for complex workflows

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Philosophy

### Code Quality
- **Readability First**: Self-documenting code with clear naming conventions
- **Modern C++**: RAII, smart pointers, const-correctness, move semantics
- **Qt Best Practices**: QObject hierarchy, signal-slot patterns, MVD architecture
- **Performance Focused**: Profile-guided optimization and caching strategies

### Testing Standards
- **Unit Tests**: ‚â•80% coverage for core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Widget interaction and file I/O validation
- **Performance Tests**: Automated benchmarking for all guarantees
- **UI Tests**: User workflow automation and accessibility compliance
