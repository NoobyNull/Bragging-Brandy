# ðŸ“œ The Constitution of the CNC Catalogue & 3D Visualization Environment

## Preamble

We, the designers and stewards of this system, establish this constitution to govern the creation of a cross-platform, Qtâ€‘based 3D Model Management Utility. **Its primary mission is the efficient tagging, organization, and discovery of 3D media assets**, with secondary capabilities for visualization, optimization, and CNC workflow preparation.

**Core Philosophy**: This is fundamentally a model management system where 3D visualization and CNC tools enhance but never complicate the primary workflow of finding, tagging, and organizing 3D models.

This environment shall be localâ€‘first, fluid, intuitive, and performanceâ€‘guaranteed. It shall serve digital artists, designers, engineers, and CNC operators with effortless model management. It shall never stall, never hide its workings, and never betray the sovereignty of its users' data.

**Interface Priority**: Fluid, responsive interaction is paramount. Every operation must feel instantaneous and intuitive, with zero learning curve for basic model management tasks.

**Performance Priority**: Large model handling (500MB+) with subâ€‘10 second load times through progressive loading, LOD rendering, and efficient memory management.

## Article I â€“ Pages & Widgets

### Pages as Canvases

A Page is a workspace surface.

Users may create, rename, duplicate, and delete Pages.

Pages persist across sessions and can be exported/imported.

### Widgets as Universal Units

Everything is a widget.

Examples: 3D Viewer, Metadata Editor, Material Library, Mesh Repair Report, File Browser, Search Panel, Background Scene Selector, Thumbnail Grid, Log Viewer.

Widgets can be added, removed, docked, nested, floated, resized, minimized, maximized.

### Docking & Layout

Widgets snap into zones (left, right, top, bottom, center).

Widgets can be tabbed together.

Widgets can pop out into floating windows, movable across monitors.

Layouts are saved per Page and globally.

### Canvas System

The application uses a tabbed canvas architecture where different workflows are organized into specialized canvases:

- **Project Canvas**: Basic project management and 3D visualization
- **Design Canvas**: Advanced 3D modeling and design operations
- **Cut List Canvas**: Material optimization and nesting
- **CNC Tools Canvas**: Tool library and feed/speed optimization
- **CNC Prep Canvas**: CNC-specific preparation and toolpath generation
- **Analysis Canvas**: Performance analysis and reporting
- **Settings Canvas**: Application and project configuration

Each canvas is composed of widgets optimized for its specific workflow, while maintaining the ability to share widgets and data across canvases.
