## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

Before contributing code, ensure you have:

- **Development Environment**: [Build Guide](build-guide.md)
- **Git**: Familiarity with version control
- **C++**: Modern C++ (C++17 or later) knowledge
- **Qt**: Experience with Qt framework
- **DirectX**: Basic understanding (for graphics contributions)

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy on GitHub
2. **Clone Locally**: `git clone <your-fork-url>`
3. **Create Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. **Set Up Development Environment**: Follow [Build Guide](build-guide.md)

### Development Standards

#### Code Style

**C++ Standards**
```cpp
// ‚úÖ Good: Modern C++ style
auto result = std::make_unique<MeshProcessor>();
const auto& vertices = mesh.getVertices();
if (const auto repaired = repairMesh(mesh)) {
    return repaired.value();
}

// ‚ùå Avoid: C-style, raw pointers
MeshProcessor* processor = new MeshProcessor();
std::vector<Vertex>* verts = mesh->getVertices();
if (repairMesh(mesh, &result)) {
    return result;
}
```

**Qt Best Practices**
```cpp
// ‚úÖ Good: QObject hierarchy, signals/slots
class MeshViewer : public QWidget {
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    explicit MeshViewer(QWidget* parent = nullptr);

signals:
    void meshLoaded(const QString& filename);
    void repairCompleted(int fixCount);

private slots:
    void onLoadButtonClicked();
    void onRepairFinished();
};

// ‚ùå Avoid: No parent, manual connections
class BadMeshViewer : public QWidget {
public:
    BadMeshViewer() {
        connect(button, SIGNAL(clicked()),
                this, SLOT(onClicked()));  // Old-style connect
    }
};
```

#### Commit Messages

```
feat: add mesh repair progress reporting

- Add progress callback to MeshRepair class
- Update UI to show repair progress
- Add cancellation support for long repairs
- Update tests for new progress API

Closes #123
```

**Commit Format**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/)
- `feat:`: New feature
- `fix:`: Bug fix
- `docs:`: Documentation changes
- `test:`: Test additions/changes
- `refactor:`: Code restructuring
- `perf:`: Performance improvements
- `ci:`: CI/CD changes

#### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests**
- Every public method must have tests
- Mock external dependencies (GPU, file I/O)
- Test both success and failure paths
- Minimum 80% code coverage

**Integration Tests**
- Widget interaction testing
- File import/export workflows
- Performance benchmarks
- Cross-platform compatibility

**Example Test Structure**
```cpp
TEST(MeshRepair, HandlesLargeModels) {
    // Arrange
    auto largeModel = LoadTestModel("large_stl_file.stl");

    // Act
    auto result = repairMesh(largeModel);

    // Assert
    EXPECT_TRUE(result.has_value());
    EXPECT_LT(result->repairTime, std::chrono::seconds(2));
    EXPECT_EQ(result->fixCount, 15);
}
```
